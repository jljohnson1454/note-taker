# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
Note Taker is an application deployed on Heroku using Node.JS and Express.JS. The starter code was provided by the UT Boot Camp module, which included everything the server.js file that I created.
Note Taker can be used similar to that of Apple Notes and Windows Notes in that you can save, add, and delete existing notes. What I merely did was route the files so that they would GET and POST notes as well as DELETE.
